## 📌 About the project

This project is part of my continuous learning journey in front-end web development.

At **16 years old**, without formal courses or prior experience, I built and published a real website by studying independently, experimenting, and iterating throughout the development process.

The project demonstrates my ability to learn quickly, apply concepts in real scenarios, and deliver functional solutions using modern front-end technologies.

All decisions regarding structure, customization, testing, and deployment were made by me.
